# it prevents you from upgrading without first removing the existing container.

# this is turned on automatically if you have `force_ha` 
# or multiple hosts with the `role` of `server`

# the host to put MySQL content there. *NOTE:* 
# `use_external_db` from above will take priority over
# this variable.

# is `True`
